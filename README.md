# 12-Arkenstone-Hyperspectral-Imaging
Arkenstone is a Python-based software package for analyzing high-speed images of shock-compressed particles. It enables advanced analysis of optical and hyperspectral emissions for studying ignition and reaction growth.
Uses filtered high-speed camera frames of shock compressed particles to spatially associate emissions to individual particles
